# Walker County Unveils State-of-the-Art Drinking Water Treatment Facility ðŸ’§

Walker County Water & Sewerage Authority (WCSWA) is proud to announce the successful completion and activation of its new **Drinking Water Treatment Facility (DWTF)**. This significant infrastructure upgrade marks a new era of enhanced water quality and capacity for our community.

## New Facility Exterior Look

The new DWTF was designed to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. We aimed for a lodge-style blend with a historic look, featuring striking stone work and Nichiha Ventagewood siding panels to complement **Chickamaugaâ€™s rich historical heritage**.

## Project Leadership and Scope

This ambitious project was managed and overseen by Randall Haney, Superintendent and Drinking Water Treatment Facility Upgrade Project Manager for the Walker County Water & Sewerage Authority.

The new facility represents a fundamental transformation from the previous infrastructure:

* **Previous Facility:** A **4.5 Million Gallons per Day (MGD) Diatomaceous Earth (DE)** treatment plant.
* **New Facility:** A modern **12 MGD Membrane Filtration** plant, with room for future expansion to a **15 MGD** capacity. (The membrane section is a new addition to the original building).

This substantial increase in capacity ensures that Walker County can reliably meet the current and future water demands of its residents and businesses.

## Engineering Excellence and Technology

The engineering for this critical upgrade was expertly handled by **CTI Engineering**. Their design incorporated cutting-edge water treatment technology, transitioning from the older DE system to highly efficient membrane filtration.

**Membrane filtration** offers several key advantages over conventional methods:

The heart of our new plant is the advanced filtration system utilizing **Pall Microza modules**. Pall is a global leader in filtration technology, and these modules provide significant operational and water quality benefits:

1.  **Absolute Barrier:** The Pall Microza modules act as an **absolute physical barrier**, ensuring $100\%$ removal of cryptosporidium, giardia, and other microbial contaminants. This provides unmatched protection against waterborne disease and ensures compliance with the most stringent EPA regulations.
2.  **Interior View:** The modules contain thousands of hollow fibers, as shown here, which perform the precise filtration process.

3.  **Increased Efficiency:** The system is designed for optimal performance, minimizing waste and energy use compared to older technologies. Furthermore, the membranes allow for **higher flux rates** (water processed per unit area), contributing directly to the plant's expanded **12 MGD capacity**.
4.  **Reliability and Automation:** The robust membrane modules and automated backwash and cleaning cycles ensure **consistent, high-quality water production** with less susceptibility to fluctuations in raw water quality and requiring less chemical pretreatment.
5.  **Superior Water Quality:** Membranes result in significantly lower turbidity (water cloudiness) than traditional filtration, consistently producing drinking water that is **crystal clear** and exceptionally safe.

We are pleased to confirm that the new 12 MGD Membrane Plant is **now fully online and operational**, successfully integrating into the WCSWA water distribution system.

This upgrade is a testament to Walker Countyâ€™s commitment to providing safe, reliable, and high-quality drinking water. We look forward to serving the community with this state-of-the-art facility for decades to come.
